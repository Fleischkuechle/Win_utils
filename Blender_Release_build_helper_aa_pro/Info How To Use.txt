Ok this is a helper batch script that streamlines the relaes build of aa pro.

it copys all files to the release folder using x copy.
it also changes some variables that are specifict for development in the init file so when the release will be used directly in blender 
the code knows where to find its stuff.
you can find some links to the appdatapath in AppDataPath.txt
ussually something like this:

C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\3.4\scripts\addons
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\3.5\scripts\addons
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.0\scripts\addons

first open blender in my case i used Blender 4.0 
go to edit preferences and remove the addon then go to the 
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.0\scripts\addons
(this can lead to error because its just a short cut)

and delete the shortcut in my case:
"C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.0\scripts\addons\Auto-Animation-pro"

then restart blender 4 and check in e preferences if the addon is gone ussullly it tells something like missing script files (because the shortcut folder was deleted.)

!!!!!!!!!!!Important  For Developer only!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
first check if the release is working by testing the release
open this folder with vs code 
D:\02\05\05\Auto_Release\output\AA_Pro
select interpreter (python interpreter from D:\02\05\05\Auto-Animation-pro\dev_env\env)
start blender !!!!!!!!!Make sure the shortcut is deleted before starting and its not installed in blender C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.0\scripts\addons




then restart blender and install the addon like any other 
in my case i install this:
"D:\02\05\05\Auto_Release\AA_Pro.zip"
this can take a while because this aa pro addon comes with mediapipe and its own ui.(470 MB)
